opcion-fork
===========

Fork of [Opcion][1] to build and run on modern JDKs. Includes various code and UI
tweaks to my own taste.

Opcion is a cross-platform font viewer. I don't want to install Qt4 and old
versions of Qt Webkit, so this will hopefully do 20% of what FontMatrix does
for me but with 80% of the effect.
